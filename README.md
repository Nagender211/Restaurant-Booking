The "Restaurant-Booking" project is a web application that allows users to book tables at restaurants. The project is built using React.js for the frontend and uses Redux for state management. The application uses a fake REST API called "jsonplaceholder" to simulate data fetching and manipulation.

The application has the following features:

A list of available restaurants that displays the restaurant name, address, and rating.
A form that allows users to book a table at a restaurant by selecting a date, time, and number of guests.
A confirmation page that displays the booking details and allows users to cancel or confirm the booking.
A user authentication system that allows users to log in or sign up to the application.
A user profile page that displays the user's booking history and allows them to cancel bookings.
